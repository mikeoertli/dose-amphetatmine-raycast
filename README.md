More information about installing/enabling [Raycast Script Commands can be found on the official GitHub page](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands).

## Why Separate Scripts?

I was unable to get the parameter passed into the `osascript` command successfully, despite some 
[useful StackOverflow guidance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67406491/osascript-how-to-pass-in-a-variable/67413043#67413043).

For expediance, this approach was used.

## Inspiration

Some inspiaration was taken from the [Alfred Dose extension](https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2021/03/22/alfred-workflow-amphetamine-app/), but this is a much more rudimentary solution.
